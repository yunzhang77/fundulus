# Wheaton College Bioinformatics 499: Fundulus heteroclitus

### Objective
In this project we were looking to use a bioinformatics pipeline to find the variation in leucine rich regions (LRR) on the genes coding for toll-like receptors in fundulus heteroclitus. This information will be used to determine if natural selection has occured for the LRR.
